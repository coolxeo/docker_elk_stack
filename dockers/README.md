##dockers
It's 3 virtual machines one per each element of the stack, connected between them with minimum configuration, if you check inside each folder there is one Dockerfile to create each container, plus the instructions to download and configure,USING the rest of the files of each folder to have a complete running setup once all dependencies have been downloaded by Docker
###*Use the run scripts in the folder to run it, it works out of the box.

    Prerequisites :

        * Docker
        * Docker-compose
