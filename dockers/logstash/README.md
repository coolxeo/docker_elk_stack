##
This project it's 3 virtual machines build with docker and docker-compose for the orchestration of the 3 services, elastic search, logstash and kibana, also there is a front-end angular client, and a backend nodejs that includes a elastic search client to consume rss from any website and persist them in the EL in a bulk process, then you can visualize them in the angular frontend and do the tipical text search over the rss's

I will keep updating the project often

Enjoy!
